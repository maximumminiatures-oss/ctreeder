    Megan's Hardening Hook: Database Connection Isolation

    is initialized once by the parent process. To avoid fatal socket sharing 
    collisions where multiple worker processes try to talk over the exact same 
    database connection pool simultaneously, we must break the inherited pool here.
    
    This forces every individual worker to establish its own safe pool post-fork.
